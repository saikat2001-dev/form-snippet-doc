# Overview

Form Snippet is a React component library that provides ready-to-use form components. It is built using **Material-UI** and **Tailwind CSS** and leverages `react-hook-form` for efficient form management and validation.

## Key Features

- **Ready-to-use Components**: Includes `TextField`, `Select`, `Checkbox`, `Radio`, and more.
- **Easy Validation**: Built-in support for validation makes it easy to handle complex form logic.
- **Simplified Development**: Reduces code complexity, allowing you to focus on your application's logic rather than form boilerplate.

## Why Form Snippet?

Building forms in React often involves a lot of repetitive code for managing state, handling errors, and styling. Form Snippet provides an "all-in-one" solution that combines the power of Material-UI's design system with the flexibility of Tailwind CSS and the performance of `react-hook-form`.
